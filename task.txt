Java Question - Auction Bid Tracker

You have been tasked with building part of a simple online auction
system which will allow users to bid on items for sale.
Provide a bid tracker interface and concrete implementation with
the following functionality:
 - Record a user's bid on an item
 - Get the current winning bid for an item
 - Get all the bids for an item
 - Get all the items on which a user has bid

You are not required to implement a GUI (or CLI) or persistent storage.
You may use any appropriate libraries to help,
but do not include the jars or class files in your submission.


my notes....

each item goes in its own auction
everytime a seller adds an item a new auction is created with startTime, startingBid, minDuration, suddenDeath
new auctions are sent as notifications
bidders can join any number of auctions
winning bids are collected into the AuctionHistory
